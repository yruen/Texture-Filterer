# Texture Filter
This is a Python script designed to sort textures dumped from **Majoras Mask 3D** to aid upscaling
It uses Pillow and ImageHash
## The script can currently sort:
1. Alpha and RGB
2. Group same textures at higher resolutions (useful for mipmaps)

## Will do in the future:
1. Resolution sorting
2. Computer Vision sorting (Tensorflow powered)
